## "A firside Chat with Dr Simon Spavound"
It's a great pleasure to provide you with a fireside chat with my good friend, Dr. Simon Spavound. He works as Head of Data Science US for the startup company Peak (https://peak.ai/).

For the past years, Simon has been involved in a multitude of AI projects across a very wide range of industries. In this fireside chat, he talks us through the data mining process and shares his knowledge from working in industry. His experience is in particular insightful for project understanding and the deployment phase. Those two parts are hardly described in any textbook but are very vital when it comes to successfully delivering a data science project.
